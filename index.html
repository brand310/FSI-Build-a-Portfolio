      <h3>About me:</h3>
      <p>
        I was born in Mexico City and moved to Los Angeles when I was only 6
        months old. Ever since I was kid I have been intrerseted in computers. I
        landed a job in 2019 as an IT for a small local school where I learned
        to build and fix computers. Even though I loved my job I always knew I
        wanted to do more. I knew how to fix them and I knew how to build them
        but now I wanted to learn how computers talked and command one another.
        Thus I enrolled into a coding boot camp where I am going strong trying
        to learn to more and more about computers.
